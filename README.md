# Discrete-Event Simulation for BFT Consensus Protocols

The code in this repository is experimental and meant to explore the simulation and the specification of BFT consensus protocols such as LibraBFT / DiemBFT.

**Note:** On December 1, 2020, the Libra Association was renamed to Diem Association. In this repository, we use LibraBFT to denote early versions of the consensus protocol now
used in the [Diem blockchain](https://github.com/diem/diem).

## The LibraBFT Simulator

In relation to the [version 2](https://diem-developers-components.netlify.app/papers/diem-consensus-state-machine-replication-in-the-diem-blockchain/2019-10-24.pdf) of the
LibraBFT report, we are providing a minimal, reference implementation of the protocol LibraBFTv2 in a discrete-event simulated environment.

Usage:
```
RUST_LOG=warn cargo run --bin librabft_simulator
```

This simulator is provided for research-purpose only and is not meant to be used in production. It will continue to evolve along with the LibraBFT whitepaper.

Example output:
